# üìö Product Requirements Document (PRD): Enterprise-Ready RAG Searcher with Chatbot & Intelligent Agents

---

## üèÜ **1. Overview**

This document defines the complete requirements for an **Enterprise-Ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Searcher**, a system that ingests and indexes multiple data sources‚Äîincluding files, websites, APIs‚Äîand offers a **conversational chatbot interface** for querying across these data. It intelligently routes user queries to determine intent (bug report, feature request, training) and returns precise answers by retrieving and generating responses from indexed content.

The system will incorporate **schema-aware search**, **vector similarity retrieval**, and **agent-based routing**, powered by **RAG indexing** with integration into **LLMs (e.g., Ollama, OpenAI)**. Designed for scalability, security, and enterprise compliance, it supports multi-source ingestion, complex retrieval workflows, and dynamic user interactions.

## üë• **2. Target Users**

* Enterprise support teams handling customer queries and bug reports.
* Software engineers and QA teams reviewing logs, codebases, and incident reports.
* Product managers seeking training resources or documentation references.
* General enterprise users with access to the chatbot for self-service knowledge retrieval.

---

## üéØ **3. Key Features**

### 3.1 Data Ingestion & Indexing

* **File Uploads:** Support PDF, DOCX, TXT, Markdown, JSON, CSV, YAML, source code files (.js, .py, .java, etc.).
* **Web Crawling:** Connect and sync external websites (e.g., HubSpot, Confluence, internal wikis). Configurable crawling frequency.
* **API Connectors:** Real-time or scheduled ingestion from APIs (Jira, GitHub, Confluence, Bitbucket) with custom mapping to internal schemas.
* **Indexing Engine:** Utilizes embeddings (e.g., Ollama, OpenAI) combined with keyword-based inverted indexes for hybrid search.
* **Schema-Aware Indexing:** Parses structured content (e.g., JSON, XML, database dumps) to enrich search accuracy and context relevance.
* **Continuous Sync & Versioning:** Maintains latest versions of ingested data with change tracking and rollback support.

### 3.2 Conversational Chatbot Interface

* **Multi-Modal Query Input:** Supports text input, voice queries, and optional file attachments.
* **Contextual Awareness:** Tracks user sessions and maintains conversation state for multi-turn dialogues.
* **Rich Media Support:** Returns responses with code snippets, tables, markdown formatting, and embedded links.
* **Customisable Prompts:** Admin-defined system and user prompts for tailored conversational flows.
* **Language Support:** Multi-language capabilities with default fallback to English.
* **Channels:** Accessible via web UI, mobile app, and integration into Slack/Teams.

### 3.3 Intelligent Query Routing & Agents

* **Intent Classification Agent:** Uses LLM-based classification to detect whether a query relates to code, bug report, feature request, or training.
* **Bug Detection Workflow:**

  * Cross-references training material and known issue databases.
  * Scans uploaded code for matching error patterns.
  * Generates internal dev notes summarizing the probable cause.
* **Feature Request Workflow:**

  * Searches backlog in Jira, Confluence product notes, and roadmap.
  * Suggests existing features if relevant or flags it as a candidate for PM review.
* **Training & Documentation Retrieval:**

  * Searches indexed training guides, FAQs, and wikis.
  * Returns precise answers with links to resources.
* **Fallback to Human Review:** If ambiguity persists, forwards the query for manual review and logs the context.

### 3.4 Retrieval and Generation (RAG) Capabilities

* **Vector Embeddings:** Built with Ollama or OpenAI embedding models (customizable).
* **Hybrid Search:** Combines vector similarity with keyword matching for optimal results.
* **Schema-Aware Retrieval:** Leverages structured data schemas for accurate extraction.
* **Prompt Engineering:** Custom retrieval prompts with pre/post-processing for high-fidelity responses.
* **Confidence Scoring:** Assigns scores to retrieval results to inform fallback decisions.
* **Streaming Responses:** Supports streaming of partial responses for large data results.

### 3.5 Admin & Management Features

* **Data Source Management:** UI to configure connectors, schedule crawls, and manage API keys.
* **Model Configuration:** Selection and fine-tuning of RAG models; toggle between providers (Ollama, OpenAI).
* **Feedback Loop:** Users can rate answers; feedback used for model refinement.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Assign user roles (admin, developer, read-only) with fine-grained permissions.
* **Audit Logging:** Comprehensive logs of data ingestion, query activities, and system actions.
* **Data Privacy & Compliance:** Encryption at rest and in transit, GDPR/CCPA compliance, data retention policies.

### 3.6 Enterprise-Ready Infrastructure

* **Deployment:** Containerised (Docker, Kubernetes) for flexible scaling.
* **Scalability:** Horizontal scalability with autoscaling groups and microservices.
* **Security:** OAuth2, SAML, LDAP integration for authentication; encrypted storage; secret management (Vault).
* **Monitoring & Observability:** Prometheus, Grafana for metrics; Loki for logs.
* **Disaster Recovery:** Regular snapshots, failover mechanisms, and multi-region support.
