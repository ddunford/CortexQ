# üìö Product Requirements Document (PRD): CortexQ - AI-Powered Knowledge Management Platform

---

## üèÜ **1. Overview**

This document defines the complete requirements for an **Enterprise-Ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Searcher**, a system that ingests and indexes multiple data sources‚Äîincluding files, websites, APIs‚Äîand offers a **conversational chatbot interface** for querying across these data. It intelligently routes user queries to determine intent (bug report, feature request, training) and returns precise answers by retrieving and generating responses from indexed content.

The system will incorporate **schema-aware search**, **vector similarity retrieval**, and **agent-based routing**, powered by **RAG indexing** with integration into **LLMs (e.g., Ollama, OpenAI)**. Designed for scalability, security, and enterprise compliance, it supports multi-source ingestion, complex retrieval workflows, and dynamic user interactions.

**üîí CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: The system MUST maintain complete **multi-tenant organization isolation** with zero cross-organization data leakage across all services, processors, and data stores.

* Software engineers and QA teams reviewing logs, codebases, and incident reports.
* Product managers seeking training resources or documentation references.
* General enterprise users with access to the chatbot for self-service knowledge retrieval.
